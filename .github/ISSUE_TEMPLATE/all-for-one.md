## 3. Social

### Instructions ‚ùì

Are you planning to discuss your query publicly? (Blog Post, social networks, etc).

**We would love to [help you] spread the word about the good work you are doing.**

### Your answer üëá

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [ ] Yes, I already have: [link](link)

## 4. Result(s)

### Instructions ‚ùì

- Provide at least one useful result found by your query, on some revision of a real project.
- If the result(s) is **fixed and disclosed**, then you can link it in this PR.
- If the result(s) is **NOT** fixed **nor disclosed**, then you can privately share your result via email to [security@github.com](mailto:security@github.com?subject=[BugBounty]%20Issue%20#000%20useful%20result) or on the [Security Lab slack](https://ghsecuritylab.slack.com/) sending it to `@TODO`.
- Even though your query is **out in the wild** (and it's quite trivial to run it against a sizable batch of projects), let's **not make things easy** for anyone wanting to exploit vulnerable projects.
- We understand that contacting maintainers of all the vulnerable repositories found by your query is a hard and lenghty process, and that's why we will add a bonus if you will do that **for at least X repositories** and get a [CVE assigned for them].
- Anyway, we're here for **automating things away** and if you want to leave the heavy lifting of finding and notifying vulnerable repositories' owners to GitHub security bots, that's fine with us.
- But in any case, we need proof that you **did your own reaserch** on [real projects], and succeeded in finding at least one **true positive result [through your query]**, proving that is it a **real vulnerability** that happens in real apps (and not a baseless assumption).

### Your answer üëá (select one)

- [ ] I will provide the result(s) **privately** to the Security Lab.

**OR**

- [ ] The vulnerability is already **fixed and disclosed**.
	- Description: URL to vulnerable code

## 5. CVE ID(s)

### Instructions ‚ùì

List the CVE ID(s) associated with this vulnerability. GitHub will automatically link CVE IDs to the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories).


### Your answer üëá

- Existing CVEs that my query would have been able to find if they weren't already fixed:
	1. CVE-20nn-nnnnn

- Vulnerabilities that my query found and then resulted in a CVE:
	1. CVE-20nn-nnnnn
